# About me ðŸ‘‹

**Holly-woot/Holly-woot** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on recovering from a hip surgery and getting my muscle strength and mobility back.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently relarning how to play the piano!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love being outside in the woods. If I'm not home or at an appointment I'm usually wondering around in the woods. It's my happy place. ðŸ™‚
